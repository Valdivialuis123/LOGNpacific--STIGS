synopsis -A system faces an increased vulnerability threat if the built-in guest account is not disabled. This account is a known account that exists on all Windows systems and cannot be deleted. This account is initialized during the installation of the operating system with no password assigned.

CODE: # Disable the built-in Guest account
Try {
    $guest = Get-LocalUser -Name "Guest"
    
    if ($guest.Enabled -eq $true) {
        Disable-LocalUser -Name "Guest"
        Write-Output "Guest account has been disabled successfully."
    }
    else {
        Write-Output "Guest account is already disabled."
    }
}
Catch {
    Write-Error "Guest account not found or an error occurred."
}
