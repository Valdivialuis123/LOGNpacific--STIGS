Synopsis: Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.
Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. 
Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events determines whether Windows generates audit events for other logon or logoff events. 
Logon events are essential to understanding user activity and detecting potential attacks.


Manual Solution
Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Advanced Audit Policy Configuration >> System Audit Policies >> Logon/Logoff >> 'Audit Other Logon/Logoff Events' with 'Success' selected.
